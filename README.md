# Employee Database SQL

## Background

A database of employees at Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s is contained in the 'data' folder of this repository, in the form of six CSV files. An image of an entity relationship diagram (ERD) of the tables can be found in the 'EmployeeSQL'. In the same folder, there are two SQL files: (1) TableSchemataSQL.sql, which designs tables to hold the data contained in the CSVs, and (2) QueriesSQL.sql, which answers questions concerning the data.
